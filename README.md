# CFG to Regex Compiler
A small tool to convert context-free grammars (written in ANTLR syntax) into a regex.

Modern regex engines support many features that exceed the expressiveness of classic regular expressions, e.g. recursion, backreferences and lookaround, thus making it possible to encode arbitrary CFGs in a single regex.
